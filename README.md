# break-reminder

We all know sitting too long is bad for our health, and doctors suggest we should at least leave the desk for a short break every 50 minutes or an hour.

Working as a software engineer, the norm is sitting at a desk all day and coding. I have checked some break reminders readily available, and most of them are in the form of mobile apps, which require manually starting the timer every time.

This project aims to solve this issue by running the tracking service on Raspberry Pi, which requires no manual input once the initial setup is completed.
